# ðŸ”§ Fix GitHub Actions Build Error

## The Problem
Your GitHub Actions workflow is failing because it can't find the required asset files:
- `assets/icon.png`
- `assets/adaptive-icon.png` 
- `assets/splash.png`
- `assets/favicon.png`

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Create Placeholder Assets (Recommended)
Run this in your `coloring-book-clean` directory:

```powershell
.\create-placeholder-assets.ps1
```

This creates minimal placeholder PNG files that will allow the build to succeed.

### Option 2: Copy Real Assets
If you have actual app icons, copy them to the `assets/` directory:

```
assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ icon.png (1024x1024)
â”œâ”€â”€ adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024)
â”œâ”€â”€ splash.png (1284x2778)
â””â”€â”€ favicon.png (48x48)
```

### Option 3: Disable GitHub Actions Temporarily
If you don't need automatic builds right now, you can:

1. Delete the `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Push your code without the workflow
3. Add the workflow back later when you have proper assets

## Updated Workflow
I've already updated your GitHub Actions workflow to automatically create placeholder assets if they're missing, so future builds should work even without manual intervention.

## After Fixing
Once you've created the assets:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "ðŸŽ¨ Add placeholder assets for GitHub Actions"
git push
```

Your GitHub Actions should now build successfully! âœ…

## For Production
Before publishing your app:
1. Replace placeholder assets with proper app icons
2. Update the app name and bundle identifier in `app.json`
3. Test the build locally with `npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean`
